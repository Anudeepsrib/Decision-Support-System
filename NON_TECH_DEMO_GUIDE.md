# Executive Demo Guide: ARR Truing-Up Decision Support System

Welcome to the **ARR Truing-Up Decision Support System** (DSS). This application is designed to modernize and automate the review of Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR) petitions using AI, ensuring strict compliance with the KSERC MYT Framework 2022-27.

This guide provides a complete, step-by-step walkthrough for **non-technical stakeholders** to set up the environment from scratch and experience every core capability of the system.

---

## 📌 Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure the following software is installed on your computer. If any of these are missing, ask your IT team to install them — it takes under 5 minutes.

| Software | Minimum Version | How to Check | Download Link |
|----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Python** | 3.10 or higher | `python --version` | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **Node.js** | 18 or higher | `node --version` | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **Git** | Any recent version | `git --version` | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |

> **Tip:** On Windows, open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** to run these check commands. On Mac, open the **Terminal** app.

---

## 🛠️ 1. Environment Setup (First-Time Only)

This section only needs to be done **once** when you first download the project. It creates an isolated Python workspace and installs all required libraries.

### Step 1.1 — Clone the Repository

If you haven't already downloaded the project, open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anudeepsrib/Decision-Support-System.git
cd Decision-Support-System
```

### Step 1.2 — Create a Python Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps the project's Python packages separate from your system Python. This prevents conflicts with other software.

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

> **How do I know it worked?** You will see `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt. This confirms you are inside the virtual environment.

### Step 1.3 — Install Python Dependencies

With the virtual environment active (you should see `(venv)` in your prompt), install all backend packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs ~68 packages including FastAPI (web server), PyPDF2/pdfplumber (PDF reading), scikit-learn/pandas (data processing), and all security libraries. It may take 2-5 minutes depending on your internet speed.

### Step 1.4 — Install Frontend Dependencies

Now install the React frontend packages:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

This downloads the React UI framework, Recharts (interactive charts), Axios (API calls), and other interface libraries into the `frontend/node_modules/` folder.

### Step 1.5 — Configure Environment Variables

The application needs a small configuration file to know how to connect to services.

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example backend\.env        # Windows
   cp .env.example backend/.env          # Mac/Linux
   ```
2. Open `backend/.env` in any text editor and fill in your actual API keys:
   - **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** — Your private OpenAI API key (for AI-powered extraction and tariff generation).
   - **`SECRET_KEY`** — Any random 32+ character string (for securing login tokens).
   - Leave all other values at their defaults for local demo use.

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:** Never share your `.env` file or commit it to Git. It contains private API keys.

### Step 1.6 — Generate Demo PDF Files (Optional)

The project includes 3 pre-built sample PDFs in `data/demo_files/`. If they are missing or you want to regenerate them, run:

```bash
pip install reportlab
python generate_demo_data.py
```

This creates three realistic regulatory PDFs:
| File | Description | SBU |
|------|-------------|-----|
| `1_True_Up_Petition_SBU_D_FY25.pdf` | Truing-Up Petition (Distribution) | SBU-D |
| `2_Audited_Financials_SBU_G_FY25.pdf` | Statutory Audit Report (Generation) | SBU-G |
| `3_Transmission_Loss_Report_FY25.pdf` | Line Loss Compliance Report (Transmission) | SBU-T |

---

## 🚀 2. Starting the Application

Every time you want to run the demo, you need to start **two servers** — the backend (engine) and the frontend (visual interface). Open **two separate terminal windows** in the project's root folder.

### Terminal 1 — Backend Server (The Engine)

Activate the virtual environment first, then start the server:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
$env:DEBUG="true"; python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
.\venv\Scripts\activate
set DEBUG=true && python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
export DEBUG="true" && uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

> **What does `--reload` do?** It automatically restarts the backend when code changes are detected. This is useful for development but not needed for presentations.

✅ **Success indicator:** You will see output like:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

You can verify the backend is healthy by opening [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) in your browser — this shows the interactive API documentation.

### Terminal 2 — Frontend Interface (The UI)

In a **separate** terminal window:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

✅ **Success indicator:** Your default web browser will automatically open to **`http://localhost:3000`**. You will see the login screen.

> **Note:** If the browser doesn't open automatically, manually navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## 🔐 3. Logging In

The system enforces **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, meaning different users see different features based on their role. For the full demo experience, use the **Regulatory Officer** account:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Email** | `regulatory.officer@kserc.gov.in` |
| **Password** | `DemoPass123!` |

This account has **full access** to all three Strategic Business Units (SBU-G, SBU-T, SBU-D) and all system features.

### Other Available Demo Accounts

| Email | Password | Role | Access Level |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `auditor@utility.com` | `DemoPass123!` | Senior Auditor | SBU-D only |
| `data.entry@utility.com` | `DemoPass123!` | Data Entry Agent | SBU-D only (upload-focused) |
| `analyst@utility.com` | `DemoPass123!` | Readonly Analyst | All SBUs (view-only) |

> **Demo Tip:** To showcase the security model, log in as the Auditor in a separate incognito window and show how they cannot access SBU-G or SBU-T data. This demonstrates data isolation.

---

## 📊 4. The Dashboard (Command Center)

Upon logging in, you will land on the **Dashboard**. This is the executive overview providing a real-time snapshot of regulatory compliance across all SBUs.

### Key Features to Demonstrate:

**a) Welcome Card**
- Confirms your authenticated identity, role, and which SBUs you have access to (e.g., "Access to SBU-G, SBU-T, SBU-D").
- Demonstrates that the system is aware of your permissions.

**b) Efficiency Analysis Module (Line Loss Calculator)**
- This is an interactive widget that evaluates Transmission & Distribution (T&D) line loss against the KSERC normative trajectory.
- **Live Demo Steps:**
  1. In the "Actual Loss %" input box, enter **`11.50`** (the target value).
  2. Click **"Evaluate"**.
  3. ✅ A **green success message** appears — the utility is within compliance.
  4. Now change the value to **`12.20`** and click **"Evaluate"** again.
  5. 🔴 The system instantly switches to a **red alert**, cites the specific regulatory clause, and calculates the estimated **penalty in Crores (₹)** that the utility would face.
- **Why this matters:** This takes an analyst hours to manually calculate — the system does it in milliseconds with full regulatory traceability.

**c) Multi-Year Historical Trends**
- Scroll down to see interactive **Recharts** line/bar graphs tracking:
  - **Approved vs. Actual ARR** costs over multiple financial years.
  - **Net Revenue Gap** trajectory (surplus or deficit over time).
- **Demo Tip:** Hover over the charts to see exact values for each year. This helps stakeholders instantly understand cost trends without reading 100-page reports.

## 📄 5. Ingesting Petitions (PDF Uploader)

Now we simulate receiving a massive, unstructured PDF petition from a utility company — the core use case of the system.

### Steps:

1. Click **"Upload PDF"** in the top navigation bar.
2. Open your computer's file explorer and navigate to the `data/demo_files/` folder inside this project.
3. **Drag and drop** the file named **`1_True_Up_Petition_SBU_D_FY25.pdf`** into the upload zone (or click to browse).
4. Watch the progress indicator as the AI engine processes the document.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes:

The system executes a sophisticated multi-step pipeline:

1. **PDF Parsing** — The engine reads the document using multiple extractors (PyPDF2, pdfplumber, Camelot) to handle different PDF formats.
2. **Table Detection** — AI identifies structured tables embedded within paragraphs of unstructured text.
3. **Value Extraction** — Key financial metrics are intelligently identified (e.g., "Rs. 180.00 Cr" for O&M Cost, "Rs. 150.00 Cr (Audited)" for actual values).
4. **Confidence Scoring** — Each extracted value receives a confidence percentage based on text clarity, table structure, and contextual clues.
5. **Source Provenance** — The system records exactly where each number was found (page number, table index, cell reference) for full auditability.
6. **OCR Fallback** — If a PDF is a scanned image (no native text layer), the system automatically falls back to Tesseract OCR to read the document.

> **Demo Tip:** After uploading, you can also upload the other two sample files (`2_Audited_Financials_SBU_G_FY25.pdf` and `3_Transmission_Loss_Report_FY25.pdf`) to show the system handles multiple SBUs and document types.

## 🤖 6. Validating AI Intelligence (Mapping Workbench)

This is the **Human-in-the-Loop** stage — the heart of the system's "zero-hallucination" policy. The AI does not silently alter data; it operates as an assistant, requiring explicit human confirmation before any data enters the regulatory calculation engine.

### Steps:

1. Click **"Mapping Workbench"** in the top navigation bar.
2. You will see the **"Pending AI Suggestions"** — data the AI extracted from uploaded petitions.

### Key Features to Highlight:

**a) Confidence Scores**
- Each extracted value shows a percentage confidence score.
- High-confidence items (85%+) are typically correct but still require human sign-off.
- Low-confidence items (<70%) are flagged with a warning — these **must** be manually reviewed.

**b) Source Traceability**
- Every value includes its provenance: exactly which **page**, **table**, and **cell** it was extracted from (e.g., "Page 12, Table 1, Cell C4").
- This allows the auditor to open the original PDF and verify the AI's reading.

**c) Standardization**
- The AI maps raw, messy text values (e.g., "Rs. 180.00 Cr") into the standardized **KSERC Chart of Accounts** database categories (e.g., "O&M (Controllable)", "Power_Purchase (Uncontrollable)").

**d) Confirm or Override**

| Action | When to Use | What Happens |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| ✅ **Confirm** (Checkmark) | AI suggestion is correct | Value is locked into the regulatory ledger |
| ✏️ **Override** | AI misclassified a value | Human corrects the category; a mandatory comment is required |
| ❌ **Reject** | Extracted value is wrong | Value is discarded; logged for audit trail |

**e) Live Demo — Override Scenario:**
- Find a mapping with lower confidence (e.g., 67%).
- Click **Override** and change the category (e.g., from "O&M" to "Admin").
- Add a comment: *"Legal fees include regulatory compliance work — reclassifying as Admin per Regulation 7.2"*.
- Click **Submit**. Notice that every override is permanently logged with a timestamp, user identity, original value, new value, and mandatory comment.

> **Why this matters:** This proves to regulators that no data enters the system without human authorization. The audit trail is immutable — it can be reviewed years later for compliance verification.

## 📈 7. Generating Analytical Reports

The ultimate goal of the system — reducing weeks of manual calculation to a single click.

### Steps:

1. Click **"Reports"** in the top navigation bar.
2. Select **Financial Year: 2024-25**.
3. Optionally select a specific SBU filter, or leave it blank to see all SBUs.
4. Click **"Generate Report"**.

### What the Report Shows:

**a) Instant Variance Calculation**
- The system immediately compares the AI-extracted **"Actual"** figures (confirmed by the human in Step 6) against the MYT **"Approved"** baseline.
- It computes the exact **net variance** in Crores (e.g., "₹-30.00 Cr, -1.2%").

**b) Regulatory Disposition Rules**
- The **Deterministic Rule Engine** automatically applies the correct KSERC mathematical formulas:
  - **Controllable gains** (e.g., O&M savings): Shared 2/3 to Utility, 1/3 to Consumer (per Regulation 9.2).
  - **Uncontrollable losses** (e.g., Power Purchase spikes): 100% pass-through to consumers (per Regulation 9.4).
  - **Controllable losses**: Automatically disallowed — the utility bears the full cost.
- The AI **never guesses** these numbers. They are calculated by hardcoded strict logic.

**c) Anomaly Detection**
- The system flags **severe deviations** that require manual auditing (e.g., a sudden 50% jump in Power Purchase costs from the previous year).
- These are highlighted with warning icons and threshold breach indicators.

**d) AI-Generated Insights & Recommendations**
- Scroll down to the **"AI Insights"** section. The system writes the initial draft of a regulatory narrative:
  > 💡 *"The O&M head for SBU-D shows a controllable GAIN of ₹30 Crores. This represents efficient management of controllable factors. Per Regulation 9.2, savings are shared 2/3 to Utility, 1/3 to Consumer."*
  
  > ⚠️ *"ALERT: Power Purchase for SBU-G shows an uncontrollable LOSS of ₹50 Crores due to market price spikes. Fully passed through per Regulation 9.4."*

**e) Tariff Draft Generation (LLM-Powered)**
- Scroll to the **"Regulatory Executive Draft"** section.
- Click **"Generate Draft"** to invoke the GPT-4o-mini language model.
- The system auto-generates a 3-paragraph regulatory narrative based on the computed variances.
- **Crucially, the human can edit this draft text before saving** — the AI assists, the human decides.

## 🔧 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Backend won't start

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `python: command not found` | Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed and added to your system PATH. Try `python3` instead of `python`. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | You forgot to activate the virtual environment. Run `.\venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux) first. |
| `Address already in use (port 8000)` | Another process is using port 8000. On Windows, run `netstat -ano | findstr :8000` to find and stop it. |
| `pip install` fails | Ensure you have internet access. If behind a corporate proxy, configure pip with `pip install --proxy http://proxy:port -r requirements.txt`. |

### Frontend won't start

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `npm: command not found` | Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). |
| Build errors after `npm start` | Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `cd frontend && rmdir /s /q node_modules && npm install` (Windows) or `cd frontend && rm -rf node_modules && npm install` (Mac/Linux). |
| Blank page in browser | Check that the backend is running on port 8000. The frontend proxies API calls to `http://localhost:8000`. |

### Login issues

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Invalid credentials" | Double-check: email is `regulatory.officer@kserc.gov.in`, password is `DemoPass123!` (case-sensitive, with exclamation mark). |
| "Network Error" | Ensure the backend server (Terminal 1) is running. Check the terminal for error messages. |
| Page stuck on "Loading..." | Clear your browser's `localStorage`: open DevTools (F12) → Application → Local Storage → Clear All. Then refresh. |
